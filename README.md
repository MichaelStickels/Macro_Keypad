## Description

This small 4x2 macro keypad offers 8 fully customizeable keys at easy reach for productivity, creative work, gaming, or other use cases. Set each key to any combination of button presses and add your own icons to the relegendable keycaps to have any shortcut, macro, or keybind ready at the push of a button. The custom PCB provides a rigid deck for the keys, as well as n-key rollover and LED backlighting. The 3D printed case angles the keys towards you for ease of use and rubber feet for grip on a slick desk.

### Features

- Low-cost, especially compared to similar products on the market ([Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck)).
- Easily customizeable: Design your own icons for the keycaps and set each key to any combination of button presses you want in the Arduino file.
- LED backlight ready.
- Open source and fully customizeable.

### Parts

- Arduino Pro Micro (or knockoff) [[link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640)]
- Cherry MX Switches [[link](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cherry-americas-llc/MX1A-11NW/91134)]
- Relegendable Keycaps [[link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M023NFK?psc=1)]
- Some Headers and Jumper Cables/Wires
- 10kÎ© Pullup Resistors
- 1N4148 Diodes (or similar)

I used some heat-set threaded inserts, but if you wanted to cut cost you could just screw directly into the plastic case or even just use some hot glue to secure the PCB.

### Disclaimer

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Any Arduino can be used, as long as it is capable of acting as a HID (Human Interface Device). To find out if your Arduino supports it, simply google '[Arduino Name] HID keyboard'.

**Note:** The case design may need modifying to fit a different or larger board.
