## Description

This small 4x2 macro keypad offers 8 fully customizeable keys at easy reach for productivity, creative work, gaming, or other use cases. Set each key to any combination of button presses and add your own icons to the relegendable keycaps to have any shortcut, macro, or keybind ready at the push of a button. The custom PCB provides a rigid deck for the keys, as well as n-key rollover and LED backlighting. The 3D printed case angles the keys towards you for ease of use and rubber feet for grip on a slick desk.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Any Arduino can be used, as long as it is capable of acting as a HID (Human Interface Device). To find out if your Arduino supports it, simply google '[Arduino Name] HID keyboard'. **Note:** The case design may need modifying to fit a different or larger board.

### Install

Ideally, write a script whose usage is described here.

### Configure

Manual, context-specific tasks not covered in the installation process.

### Usage

GIFs are useful here to see the project in action.

### Troubleshooting

Or FAQs, if that's more appropriate.
